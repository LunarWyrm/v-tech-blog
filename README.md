# V-Tech Blog

V-Tech is a simple tech blog where users can log in, create, edit, and delete posts.

## Helpers
- Tutor helped me by showing me where I could reuse code from previous projects done within class. Used starter code from one of the mini project.

- ChatGPT assisted me with proper syntax and more specifically which files include what paths, as well as what types of data to include in my models.
